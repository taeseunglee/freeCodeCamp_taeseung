Call out Optional Actions with Button Info
Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-info class is used to call
attention to optional actions that the user can take.

Create a new block-level Bootstrap button below your "Like" button with the text "Info", and add
Bootstrap's btn-info and btn-block classes to it.

Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.
