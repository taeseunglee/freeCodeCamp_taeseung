Line up Form Elements Responsively with Bootstrap
Now let's get your form input and your submission button on the same line. We'll do this the same way we have previously: by using a div element with the class row, and other div elements within it using the col-xs-* class.

Nest both your form's text input and submit button within a div with the class row. Nest your form's text input within a div with the class of col-xs-7. Nest your form's submit button in a div with the class col-xs-5.

This is the last challenge we'll do for our Cat Photo App for now. We hope you've enjoyed learning Font Awesome, Bootstrap, and responsive design!
