Make Images Mobile Responsive
First, add a new image below the existing one. Set its src attribute to
https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats.

It would be great if this image could be exactly the width of our phone's screen.

Fortunately, with Bootstrap, all we need to do is add the img-responsive class to your image. Do
this, and the image should perfectly fit the width of your page.

  You should have a total of two images.
  Your new image should be below your old one and have the class img-responsive.
  Your new image should not have the class smaller-image.
  Your new image should have a src of https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats.
  Make sure your new img element has a closing angle bracket.
