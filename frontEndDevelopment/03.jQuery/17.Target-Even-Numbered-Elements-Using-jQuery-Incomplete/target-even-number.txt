Target Even Numbered Elements Using jQuery
You can also target all the even-numbered elements.

Here's how you would target all the odd-numbered elements with class target and give them classes:

$(".target:odd").addClass("animated shake");

Note that jQuery is zero-indexed, meaning that, counter-intuitively, :odd selects the second element, fourth element, and so on.

Try selecting all the even-numbered elements and giving them the classes of animated and shake.

All the target elements that computer considers even should shake.
You should use the :even function to modify these elements.
Only use jQuery to add these classes to the element.
