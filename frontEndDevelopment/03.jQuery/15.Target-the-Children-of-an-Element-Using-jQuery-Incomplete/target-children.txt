Target the Children of an Element Using jQuery
Many HTML elements have children which inherit their properties from their parent HTML elements.

For example, every HTML element is a child of your body element, and your "jQuery Playground" h3 element is a child of your <div class="container-fluid"> element.

jQuery has a function called children() that allows you to access the children of whichever element you've selected.

Here's an example of how you would use the children() function to give the children of your left-well element the color of blue:

$("#left-well").children().css("color", "blue")

Give all the children of your #right-well element a color of orange.

All children of #right-well should have orange text.
You should use the children() function to modify these elements.
Only use jQuery to add these classes to the element.
