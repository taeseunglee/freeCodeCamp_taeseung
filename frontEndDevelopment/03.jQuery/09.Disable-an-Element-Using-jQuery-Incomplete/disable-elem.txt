Disable an Element Using jQuery
You can also change the non-CSS properties of HTML elements with jQuery. For example, you can disable buttons.

When you disable a button, it will become grayed-out and can no longer be clicked.

jQuery has a function called .prop() that allows you to adjust the properties of elements.

Here's how you would disable all buttons:

$("button").prop("disabled", true);

Disable only the target1 button.

Disable your target1 button.
Do not disable any other buttons.
Only use jQuery to add these classes to the element.
