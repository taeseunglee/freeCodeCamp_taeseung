Style Multiple Elements with a CSS Class
Remember that you can attach classes to HTML elements by using class="your-class-here"
within the relevant element's opening tag.

Remember that CSS class selectors require a period at the beginning like this:

  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
  }
But also remember that class declarations don't use a period, like this:

<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Apply the red-text class to your h2 and p elements.
