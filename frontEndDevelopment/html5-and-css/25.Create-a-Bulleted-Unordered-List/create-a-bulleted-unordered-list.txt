Create a Bulleted Unordered List
HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point-style lists.

Unordered lists start with a <ul> element. Then they contain some number of <li> elements.

For example:

<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
    <li>cheese</li>
    </ul>
    would create a bullet point-style list of "milk" and "cheese".

    Remove the last two p elements and create an unordered list of three things that cats love at
    the bottom of the page.

  Create a ul element.
  You should have three li elements within your ul element.
  Make sure your ul element has a closing tag.
  Make sure your li elements have closing tags.
