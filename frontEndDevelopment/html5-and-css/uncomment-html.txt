Uncomment HTML
Commenting is a way that you can leave comments within your code without affecting the code itself.

Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

You can start a comment with <!-- and end a comment with -->

Uncomment your h1, h2 and p elements.

Make your h1 element visible on your page by uncommenting it.
