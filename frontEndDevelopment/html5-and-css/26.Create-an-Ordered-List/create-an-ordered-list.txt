Create an Ordered List
HTML has a special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered-style lists.

Ordered lists start with a <ol> element. Then they contain some number of <li> elements.

For example:

<ol>
  <li>Garfield</li>
    <li>Sylvester</li>
    </ol>
    would create a numbered list of "Garfield" and "Sylvester".
