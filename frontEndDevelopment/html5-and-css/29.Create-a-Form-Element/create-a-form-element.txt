Create a Form Element
You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You
can do this by specifying an action on your form element.

For example:

<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data"></form>

Nest your text field in a form element. Add the action="/submit-cat-photo" attribute to this form
element.

  Nest your text input element within a form element.
  Make sure your form has an action attribute which is set to /submit-cat-photo
  Make sure your form element has a closing tag.
