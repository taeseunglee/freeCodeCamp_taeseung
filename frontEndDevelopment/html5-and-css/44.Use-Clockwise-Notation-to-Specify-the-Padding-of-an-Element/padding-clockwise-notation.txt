Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Padding of an Element
Instead of specifying an element's padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left
properties, you can specify them all in one line, like this:

padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;

These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left, and will produce the exact same
result as using the side-specific padding instructions.

Use Clockwise Notation to give the ".green-box" class a padding of 40px on its top and left side,
    but only 20px on its bottom and right side.
