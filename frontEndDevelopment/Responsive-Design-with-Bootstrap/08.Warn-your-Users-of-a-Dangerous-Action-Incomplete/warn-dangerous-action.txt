Warn your Users of a Dangerous Action
Bootstrap comes with several pre-defined colors for buttons. The btn-danger class is the button
color you'll use to notify users that the button performs a destructive action, such as deleting a
cat photo.

Create a button with the text "Delete" and give it the class btn-danger.

Note that these buttons still need the btn and btn-block classes.

  Create a new button element with the text "Delete".
  All of your Bootstrap buttons should have the btn and btn-block classes.
  Your new button should have the class btn-danger.
  Make sure all your button elements have a closing tag.
