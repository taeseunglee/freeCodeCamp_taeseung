Create a Block Element Bootstrap Button
Normally, your button elements with a class of btn are only as wide as the text that they contain.
For example:

<button class="btn">Submit</button>

This button would only be as wide as the word "Submit".

Submit

By making them block elements with the additional class of btn-block, your button will stretch to
fill your page's entire horizontal space and any elements following it will flow onto a "new line"
below the block.

<button class="btn btn-block">Submit</button>

This button would take up 100% of the available width.

Submit

Note that these buttons still need the btn class.

Add Bootstrap's btn-block class to your Bootstrap button.

  Your button should still have the class btn.
  Your button should have the class btn-block.
  Make sure all your button elements have a closing tag.
