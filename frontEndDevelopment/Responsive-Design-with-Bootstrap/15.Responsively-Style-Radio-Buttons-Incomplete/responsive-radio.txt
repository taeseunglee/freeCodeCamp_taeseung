Responsively Style Radio Buttons
You can use Bootstrap's col-xs-* classes on form elements, too! This way, our radio buttons will be evenly spread out across the page, regardless of how wide the screen resolution is.

Nest all of your radio buttons within a <div class="row"> element. Then nest each of them within a <div class="col-xs-6"> element.

Nest all of your radio buttons inside one div with the class row.
Nest each of your radio buttons inside its own div with the class col-xs-6.
Make sure each of your div elements has a closing tag.
