Add ID Attributes to Bootstrap Elements
Recall that in addition to class attributes, you can give each of your elements an id attribute.

Each id must be unique to a specific element and used only once per page.

Let's give a unique id to each of our div elements of class well.

Remember that you can give an element an id like this:

<div class="well" id="center-well">

Give the well on the left the id of left-well. Give the well on the right the id of right-well.
