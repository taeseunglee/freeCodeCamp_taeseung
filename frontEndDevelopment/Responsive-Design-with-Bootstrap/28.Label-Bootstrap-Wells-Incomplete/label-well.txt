Label Bootstrap Wells
For the sake of clarity, let's label both of our wells with their ids.

Above your left-well, inside its col-xs-6 div element, add a h4 element with the text #left-well.

Above your right-well, inside its col-xs-6 div element, add a h4 element with the text #right-well.

Add an h4 element to each of your <div class="col-xs-6"> elements.
One h4 element should have the text #left-well.
One h4 element should have the text #right-well.
Make sure all your h4 elements have closing tags.
