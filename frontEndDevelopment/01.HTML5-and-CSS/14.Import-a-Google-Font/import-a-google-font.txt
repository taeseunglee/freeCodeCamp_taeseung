Import a Google Font
Now, let's import and apply a Google font (note that if Google is blocked in your country, you will
    need to skip this challenge).

First, you'll need to make a call to Google to grab the Lobster font and load it into your HTML.

Copy the following code snippet and paste it into the top of your code editor:

<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">

Now you can set Lobster as a font-family value on your h2 element.

Apply the font-family of Lobster to your h2 element.

Run tests (ctrl + enter)
  Reset Help  Bug
  Import the Lobster font.
  Your h2 element should use the font Lobster.
  Your p element should still use the font Monospace.
