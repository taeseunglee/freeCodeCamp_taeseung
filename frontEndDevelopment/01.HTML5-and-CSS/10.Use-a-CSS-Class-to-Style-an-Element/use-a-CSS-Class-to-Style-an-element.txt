Use a CSS Class to Style an Element
Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements.

Here's an example CSS class declaration:

  <style>
    .blue-text {
        color: blue;
      }
</style>
You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag.

You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:

  <h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

  Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. In your HTML elements'
  class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period.

  Inside your style element, change the h2 selector to .red-text and update the color's value from
  blue to red.

  Give your h2 element the class attribute with a value of 'red-text'.

  Your h2 element should be red.
  Your h2 element should have the class red-text.
  Your stylesheet should declare a red-text class and have its color set to red.
  Do not use inline style declarations like style="color: red" in your h2 element.
