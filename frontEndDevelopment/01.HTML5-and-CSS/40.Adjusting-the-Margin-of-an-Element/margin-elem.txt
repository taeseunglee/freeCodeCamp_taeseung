Adjust the Margin of an Element
An element's margin controls the amount of space between an element's border and surrounding
elements.

Here, we can see that the green box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the
red box has more margin than the green box, making it appear smaller.

When you increase the green box's margin, it will increase the distance between its border and
surrounding elements.

Change the margin of the green box to match that of the red box.

  Your green-box class should give elements 20px of margin.
