Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default
You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.

To do this, just add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element. For example:

<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>

Set the first of your radio buttons and the first of your checkboxes to both be checked by
default.
