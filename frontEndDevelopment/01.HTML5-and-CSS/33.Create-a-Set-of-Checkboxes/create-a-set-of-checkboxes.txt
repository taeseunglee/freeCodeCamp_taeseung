Create a Set of Checkboxes
Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.

Checkboxes are a type of input

Each of your checkboxes should be nested within its own label element.

All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.

Here's an example of a checkbox:

<label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>

Add to your form a set of three checkboxes. Each checkbox should be nested within its own label
element. All three should share the name attribute of personality.
