Add Different Margins to Each Side of an Element
Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has a different margin on each of its
sides.

CSS allows you to control the margin of an element on all four sides with margin-top, margin-right,
    margin-bottom, and margin-left properties.

    Give the green box a margin of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and
    right side.
