Add Borders Around your Elements
CSS borders have properties like style, color and width

For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this
class:

  <style>
    .thin-red-border {
        border-color: red;
        border-width: 5px;
        border-style: solid;
      }
</style>
Create a class called thick-green-border that puts a 10-pixel-wide green border with a style of
solid around an HTML element, and apply that class to your cat photo.

Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element by separating each class with a space
within its class attribute. For example:

<img class="class1 class2">

  Your img element should have the class smaller-image.
  Your img element should have the class thick-green-border.
  Give your image a border width of 10px.
  Give your image a border style of solid.
  The border around your img element should be green.
